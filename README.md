# Health-Insurance-Website
This project is an effort to make insurance policy related information simple and understandable to everyone. We made the interface of this website as simple and precise as possible. We took only 3 most common policies into consideration. We have a home page, that lists the policies and links users to third party pages that provide payment portal for purchasing the policies. There is an FAQ page which answers important questions and highlights the benefits of health insurance. The services page provides a form wherein the customers can drop off their details and can expect a call/email from customer care. The predictor page accepts user details through a form and predicts the premium charges per year.
